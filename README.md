# env_with_obj_detection

## Introduction
This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file to detect any object using Inception ResNet models, developed by Google, stored in the tensorflow library. Depending on the outputs of the model after it is run on the image, an algorithm is written within the programme with parameters which can be tuned by the user. The algorithm basically yprocesses the outputs, and predicts the type of environment the user is in. 

## How to use
Clone this repo to your local system, then either you can use the file using Jupyter, or Google Colab. I prefer Google Colab, since it offers a GPU for the same, and has all the required libraries preinstalled :)


Please revert and leave a comment for any suggestions or bugs in the file!
